A new featured posts widget for Genesis themes that allows you to exclude a category when selecting All Categories in the featured post widget.

== Description ==
The default Genesis Featured Post widget is great, except you only have the option to include all categories or a specific category. You can exclude previously displayed posts or "sticky" posts, but you can't exclude all posts in a specific category.

This plugin was created out of a need to show all but one category in the featured post widget.

== Why Exclude a Category? ==
Most blogs focus on a certain topic - technology, food, entertainment, sports, or whatever.

Your featured post widgets should show off the posts that are geared towards the audience you are attracting to your site.

Every once in a while you may have a category that doesn't quite fit the norm. You might have your own personal thoughts, and while they are important to you, they may not fit on the homepage of your site.

You may also have a tutorial series with a dozen posts that would end up filling up your featured post widgets. You can feature the main introductory post, and hide the rest.

== Installation ==
1. Download archive and unzip in wp-content/plugins or install via Plugins – Add New.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Appearance > Widgets
4. Add the Genesis - Featured Posts Exclude Category widget to a widget area.
5. For the Category option, select All Categories. For the Exclude option, select the category that you wish to exclude.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this work with any Genesis child theme? =
Yes, this should work with any Genesis child theme.
*You must use a Genesis child theme for this plugin to work!*

= Where are the plugin settings? =
There really are no settings. The plugin adds a new widget, which can be found under Appearance > Widgets. You are looking for the *Genesis - Featured Posts Exclude Category* widget.

= How do I use the widget? =
The widget really only works if you select All Categories from the Categories select menu in the widget, and then select a category to exclude from the Exclude select menu in the widget.

Think about it, if you select a single category from the Categories select menu, it will automatically exclude all others.

If you select All Categories, you may want to exclude one. You can easily do this just by selecting it from the menu.

The rest of the widget settings are identical to the default Genesis Featured Posts widget.
